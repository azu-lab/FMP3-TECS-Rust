# Section IV-D: COMPARISON OF GENERATED AND COMPILED CODE
This directory contains the samples used in Section IV-D of the paper.

### rust_uart_sample
- A UART echo sample implemented in Rust.

### tecs_uart_sample
- A UART echo sample implemented with the proposed framework.
    - The CDL files used for lines-of-code measurement are `evaluation*.cdl`.
        - `import` statements are excluded from the measurement.
    - The auto-generated Rust code is in the `tecs_uart_sample/gen` directory.
    - The following Rust files are excluded from the hand-coded lines-of-code measurement:
        - `src/tecs_impl/t_task_rs_impl.rs` and `src/tecs_impl/t_dataqueue_rs_impl.rs`
            - Because these are impl files of kernel object components intended to be reused.
        - `kernel_cfg.rs`
            - Because it is automatically generated by bindgen.

### tecs_uart_led_sample
- A UART+LED echo sample created to evaluate reusability.
    - The CDL files used for lines-of-code measurement are `evaluation*.cdl`.
        - `import` statements are excluded from the measurement.
    - The auto-generated Rust code is in the `tecs_uart_sample/gen` directory.
    - The following Rust files are excluded from the hand-coded lines-of-code measurement:
        - `src/tecs_impl/t_task_rs_impl.rs` and `src/tecs_impl/t_dataqueue_rs_impl.rs`
            - Because these are impl files of kernel object components intended to be reused.
        - `kernel_cfg.rs`
            - Because it is automatically generated by bindgen.
